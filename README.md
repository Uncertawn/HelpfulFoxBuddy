# 1.21.8 mod that adds a custom fox entity originally made for [Builder Fox's Den SMP](https://discord.gg/exAreKYM)
I basically copied 90% of vanila fox's code just removed the unwanted behaviours that include attacking livestock
(also the entity is invulnerable because I said so)

## To be added:
* 9 slot inventory
